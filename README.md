# Interactive Portfolio - João Henrique Menezes Silva Boia

Welcome to the repository of my interactive portfolio, a cyberpunk-themed web experience that allows you to explore my skills, projects, and professional journey through a simulated chat with an AI based on my profile.

## Features

*   Cyberpunk-themed interface with visual effects.
*   Interactive chat powered by AI (Gemini API) configured with a detailed `systemPrompt` about my professional profile.
*   "Back Story" section summarizing my journey.
*   Detailed "Skills" section covering languages, frameworks, databases, cloud/DevOps, etc.
*   Direct links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email.
*   Temporary glitch effects on bot messages and interface elements.

## Setup and How to Run

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <Your Repository URL>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd porfolio page
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

**Note:** For the chat to function, you will need a Google Gemini API key and replace it in the `script.js` file on the line `const API_KEY = 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY';`. Remember the security caveat mentioned above.
